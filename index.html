    <h3>A better more mobile future</h3>
    <p>
      Metropolitan areas are growing and with that growth comes more traffic,
      worse air pollution and greater amounts of CO² released into the
      atmosphere. In cities across the globe, officials and urban planners are
      scrambling to come up with creative ways to address these issues, but they
      need all of the help they can get. To help shape the future of
      transportation, we teamed up with the Technical University of Aachen to
      design a new and innovative solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bridging the gap between e-bike and car, our future mobility concept
      presents a revolutionary alternative to both the automobile and the
      bicycle. Combining the next generation of lightweight and powerful e-bike
      design with four-wheel stability and storm-proof protection from the
      elements, our Future Mobility Concept represents a decisive step in
      re-imagining how bicycle technology can reclaim space on the streets. It
      is a clean vehicle, a statement, and a sign of what’s to come.
    </p>
    <h3>Bridging the gap</h3>
    <p>
      We’re so used to jumping in our cars that they often become the default
      choice, but sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic, it’s hard not to watch
      with jealousy as cyclists fly by in the bike lane. Yet even as the
      popularity of e-bikes skyrockets in urban areas, 45%* of potential users
      still want a form of transport that is protected from wind, rain and snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter our Future Mobility Concept. Designed to seamlessly jump from the
      street to the bike lane, this low-emission vehicle merges the best parts
      of cars and e-bikes into one to make it the ultimate daily commuter. It’s
      fast and stable enough to fly down the open road, yet light and agile
      enough to slide into the bike lane when things get backed up. The next
      step in mobility is here.
    </p>
    <p>* Based on a McKinsey study of micro mobility</p>

    <h3>Capsule concept</h3>
    <p>
      How do you bring total weather protection to an e-bike? This is the
      question our designers and engineers had to answer with the Future
      Mobility Concept. The solution is a totally-sealable passenger compartment
      surrounded by an innovative, panoramic capsule that strikes the perfect
      blend of form and function.
    </p>
    <p>
      When not sealed to protect against the elements, the capsule can be slid
      forward along two rails to open the cockpit up. This ‘open mode’ is great
      when the weather is hot or if the rider wants that fresh-breeze feeling
      that comes with driving a convertible. The capsule even has enough space
      behind the rider to seat a child, load luggage or pack up groceries for
      the ride home. The capsule can then be slid even further forward for easy
      entry and exit of the vehicle.
    </p>

    <h3>Design</h3>
    <p>
      Simple. Precise. Dynamic. Those three maxims have dictated the
      award-winning Canyon design language for years and now they have
      manifested in our new Future Mobility Concept. The futuristic aesthetic of
      the concept blends modern bike and automobile design, while the clean,
      reduced silhouette further communicates the lightweight and aerodynamic
      build of the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, the design evokes the idea of urban simplicity and a newer,
      better way of navigating the city – just like the new Precede:ON e-bike.
      Together, they represent a unified design for a more mobile future.
    </p>
  

    <h3>Ergonomics</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to a recumbent bicycle, the concept places the rider in a
      comfortable laid-back position with their feet on the pedals. The concept
      is manoeuvred using intuitive side stick steering where two joysticks
      positioned by the rider’s left and right hips turn the vehicle through its
      acute, 7-metre turning radius. The result is a comfortable and agile
      system that makes commuting safe and simple all while keeping the rider
      protected from the elements.
